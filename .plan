# And so it begins 2017-05-04

Users:

* A _listener_ is a user who is viewing/playing MIDI by other _author_s
* An _author_ is a user who is recording/streaming MIDI

Large-granularity user stories:

1. As an _author_, I should be able to record a MIDI session with my MIDI device(s)
2. As an _author_ or a _listener_, I should be able to play back a previously recorded or live streamed MIDI session on my MIDI device(s) or my computer
3. As an _author_ or a _listener_, I should be able to see MIDI playback as a piano roll, music staff, tablature, percussion notation, etc... (need to prioritize)
3. As an _author_ or a _listener_, I should be able to see a timeline/diary of any user's recorded MIDI
4. As an _author_ or a _listener_, I should be able to add (personal or public) notes to a range of recorded MIDI
5. As an _author_ or a _listener_ who has MIDI devices, I should be able to add "patches" which are stateful function transformations on streams of input/output MIDI

Unknowns that need to be taken care of:

* Name & Brand
* User Experience:
  * UI Interactions
  * Visual style (The structure of brutalist minimalism combined with the bright textures of 90s hip hop: balenciaga's website + patterns)
